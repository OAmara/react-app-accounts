REACT ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:

The app now has a fetch call to get the dogs programmed, but it doesn't work
because of CORS!! ðŸ˜¡ 

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS

BROWSERS implement this for security reasons

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing

To fix it you program your server to speak to certain clients that it recognizes

IOW: server uses HTTP headers and sometimes also a response to an OPTIONS request
to say who is allowed to connect and what they're allowed to do


install in flask server: pip3 install flask_cors (dont forget to pip freeze > requirements.txt afterward)
